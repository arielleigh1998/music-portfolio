Ariel Rodriguez is a musicologist, conductor, and soprano. 

Ariel Rodriguez is a second-year master's student in Musicology. Her thesis research centers on Artemis Singers, a self-directed lesbian-feminist chorus based in Chicago, Illinois. Her interests encompass the women’s music movement, the feminist choral movement, women’s singing circles, and convents. More broadly, Ariel’s research intersects with queer and feminist studies, spirituality, religion, and mysticism. In 2024, she presented an ethnographic study on a queer-affirming Catholic church in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Society for Ethnomusicology Southeastern Conference, and she will present this work again at the Society for American Music Conference in 2025. A classically trained soprano, Ariel channels her passion for singing and conducting into FSU's Early Music ensemble and the women’s ensemble Levana. Outside of her academic and musical pursuits, she enjoys yoga, cooking, and puzzles.

In 2020 she received a bachelor's in vocal performance and a minor in English literature from the University of Tulsa.

She also studied Spanish and the UNAM in Mexico City.

Ariel is a vegetarian and likes to cook.

She lives in Florida and does not like it.
